// The drawn text, and the floor beside it — the chrome both slots share, so the
// full view and the compact one can never disagree about what a
// LinkedIn post looks like or about what they say when there is none. It is the same
// chrome pattern the fleet's markdown base draws, so one artifact does not read
// as a different product from the next.
//
// THE ONE INJECTION POINT. The html handed to the container below comes from the
// SDK's shared markdown sanitizer and from nowhere else: the sanitizer is the
// boundary, and nothing downstream re-sanitizes. Keeping the injection in ONE
// component is what makes that reviewable — a second injection anywhere in this
// package would be a second, unreviewed road for stored content into the page,
// and the package's own test refuses one.
//
// READ-ONLY, ON EVERY SURFACE. Both slots draw and nothing else: no tabs, no
// editing affordance, no save, and no Regenerate — Regenerate is the review
// screen's control, never a renderer's. The Code and Preview tabs belong to the
// artifact page's markdown editor, which is its own item and its own wave; a
// review card mounts this display exactly as it is.
//
// A TEXT VIEW RENDERS TEXT. Nothing here draws a picture, whatever the stored
// content names: a picture is its own artifact with its own display.
