// DETAIL renderer (slot `detail`) — the full view of a LinkedIn post on the
// artifact page.
//
// It draws the text the content channel pinned, rendered to safe html by the
// SDK's shared markdown sanitizer. It is READ-ONLY: the content as it was stored
// at that revision, with no tabs, no editing affordance and no Regenerate.
//
// v1 renderer: it requests NO host ports and it never fetches. Everything it
// draws comes from the host-supplied authorized snapshot, whose content field
// carries the pinned text — which is what lets this display draw inside a
// third-party application, where a display that reached for bytes itself paints
// nothing.
//
// NEVER BLANK, NEVER THROWN: content it cannot draw becomes a named floor.
